//! Warp-level matrix operations.
//!
//! This module provides register-only matrix operations (`movmatrix` and
//! `mma.sync`) plus warp-cooperative shared-memory loads (`ldmatrix`).
//!
//! For ldmatrix, each group of four lanes loads one naturally aligned
//! 16-byte row:
//!
//! ```text
//! x1: lanes  0..7  provide addresses
//! x2: lanes  0..15 provide addresses
//! x4: lanes  0..31 provide addresses
//! ```
//!
//! On sm_75, x1 and x2 still require valid addresses in all 32 lanes. A
//! common choice is to copy the lower-lane addresses into the upper lanes.
//! The .trans forms use column-major rather than row-major layout.
//!
//! Ldmatrix is a weak memory operation: .sync converges the warp but does not
//! order memory. Callers need an appropriate barrier or fence around dependent
//! memory accesses. Movmatrix and MMA are register-only and have no memory
//! effect.

/// Transpose an 8×8 matrix of b16 elements in-register across the warp.
///
/// Each lane provides one `u32` that packs two b16 elements of the source
/// matrix. The instruction collectively transposes the 8×8 tile and writes
/// the transposed pair back into each lane's destination register.
///
/// ```text
/// input  lane 4*r + k: [matrix[r][2*k], matrix[r][2*k + 1]]
/// output lane 4*c + k: [matrix[2*k][c], matrix[2*k + 1][c]]
/// ```
///
/// This operation only exchanges register fragments between lanes. It does
/// not access memory and is not a memory fence.
